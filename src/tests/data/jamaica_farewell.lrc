[00:00.00]Jamaica Farewell
[00:08.92]The Brother Four
[00:14.32]
[00:18.50]Down the way where the nights are gay
[00:22.30]And the sun shines daily on the mountain top
[00:27.85]I took a trip on a sailing ship
[00:31.16]And when I reached Jamaica I made a stop
[00:35.51]
[00:35.89]But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
[00:40.57]Won't be back for many a day
[00:45.49]My heart is down my head is turning around
[00:49.87]I had to leave a little girl in Kingston Town
[00:54.47]
[00:57.30]Sounds of laughter everywhere
[01:00.88]And the dancing girls swaying to and fro
[01:06.35]I must declare my heart is there
[01:09.91]Though I have been from Maine to Mexico
[01:14.71]But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
[01:19.30]Won't be back for many a day
[01:24.14]My heart is down my head is turning around
[01:28.27]I had to leave a little girl in Kingston Town
[01:33.88]
[01:54.49]Down at the market you can hear
[01:57.90]Ladies cry out while on their heads they bear
[02:03.46]Ackev rice, salt fish are nice
[02:07.03]And the rum is fine anytime of year
[02:11.09]But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
[02:15.61]Won't be back for many a day
[02:20.68]My heart is down my head is turning around
[02:24.60]I had to leave a little girl in Kingston Town
[02:29.62]My heart is down my head is turning around
[02:33.55]I had to leave a little girl in Kingston Town
[02:38.78]My heart is down my head is turning around
[02:42.65]I had to leave a little girl in Kingston Town
[02:53.13]
[02:54.69]End
