# CSCI3280 Project!!

## Steps for Compilation

I used CMake here because it just works on every operating system on this planet. We can change it if this is undesirable.

1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/1155158936/csci3280-project.git
```

2. Make sure you are at the **root** of the repository. The configuration for building the files can be generated by the following command:

```sh
cmake -B build -S src -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1
```

`-B` is for the directory where the executables, cache files etc will live.
`-S` is the source directory where `CMakeLists.txt` and other source files will live.
`-D` defines variables. `CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS` specifies that a `compile_commands.json` should be generated so that language servers how to find the library headers. This is not required if you don't have these services in the text editor.

This command only needs to run after `CMakeLists.txt` is changed (to regenerate the build configuration files).

3. Compile the files with

```sh
cmake --build build [--config <Debug or Release>]
```

This builds the project. The `--config` flag may be needed for some build systems (Visual Studio?).

4. Running the program

```sh
./build/<name of executable>
```

CMake places the executable in the `build` folder.

5. Including Libraries

Use `PkgConfig` magic to find the library files and headers, like below for `gtkmm4`.

```cmake
# magic
find_package(PkgConfig)

pkg_check_modules(GTKMM_VARS REQUIRED IMPORTED_TARGET gtkmm-4.0)

target_link_libraries(p2pmss PRIVATE PkgConfig::GTKMM_VARS)

```

## Version Control

1. Before you commit the changes, add it to the staging area first. Git will only commit things that are in the staging area.

```
git add <...files>
```

Use `.` for `<...files>` if you want to stage all changes in the working directory.

2. Commit

```
git commit
```

Git will use the editor specified in `$EDITOR` environment variable. If it is empty `vim` will be used. Write the commit message, then save and quit.

By the way, don't commit build artifacts (anything that is produced by CMake)!!

3. Push to a remote repository

```
git push origin master
```

`origin` should point to the URL you used to clone this repository. If not add:

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/1155158936/csci3280-project
```

You can also push to another branch if you don't want to mess up the `master` branch.

4. Fetching remote changes

```
git fetch
```

This will sync the local database with the remote one, although it doesn't apply the changes to the working directory.

```
git pull
```

I would recommend you committing the changes in your working directory before pulling anything new.

## Formatting

I recommend following Anthony's style in `lrc.h` and `lrc.cpp`, which is **four spaces**.
